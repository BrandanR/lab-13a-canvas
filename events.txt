So for my website I plan on using a draw event
the draw event might be something simple like a dartboard similar to our lab but almost representing a logo
for the animation, I may do a Hi! Welcome To My Website and have it bounce back and fourth on the top of the screen
On the bottom of my website I'm going to add a hero image that says on top of it "Thank you for visiting my site"
